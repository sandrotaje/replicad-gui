# Replicad GUI

> A modern, web-based CAD editor combining visual sketching with code-driven 3D modeling

**Replicad GUI** is an intuitive parametric CAD application that brings the power of [Replicad](https://replicad.xyz) to your browser. Design complex 3D models through an elegant combination of 2D sketching, visual tools, and JavaScript/TypeScript code.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 2D Sketcher** - Create precise sketches with comprehensive drawing tools and dimension editing
- **🔮 Real-time 3D Preview** - See your designs come to life instantly with interactive 3D rendering
- **💻 Code Editor** - Write parametric models in JavaScript/TypeScript with Monaco editor (VS Code experience)
- **🔄 Multiple View Modes** - Switch seamlessly between split view, sketcher-only, or 3D-only layouts
- **⚡ Extrusion & Cut Operations** - Transform 2D sketches into 3D solids with powerful modeling operations
- **📐 Parametric Design** - Create intelligent models that adapt to changing parameters
- **🎯 Sketch Management** - Organize multiple sketches on different planes for complex designs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation
